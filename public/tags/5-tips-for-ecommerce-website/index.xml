&lt;p&gt;If you’re running an online business, chances are you’ve looked for ways to improve your e-commerce website. Making certain changes on your site might just be what you need to turn hesitant visitors into long-term customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do you begin? With so many different aspects you can change, what’s the best way to start the process of yielding positive results right away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve put together what we consider to be 5 of the most important aspects for an e-commerce site in today’s world. Check these tips out, and decide which ones you want to apply to your own website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your site mobile friendly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of your visitors will use their mobile device to find your website. In fact, according to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/surprising-mobile-ecommerce/&#34;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; done by Kissmetrics, 55% of e-commerce shopping is done using either a smartphone or tablet. In other words, it’s an absolute necessity to make sure that your site’s visitors can easily navigate your website with their mobile device. In addition to improving user experience, having a mobile-friendly site is also important for helping you rank high with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Keep your checkout process simple&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried purchasing something online, but given up due to an over-complicated checkout process? It happens often, and asking for too much information as the customer is checking out can be a major cause for this. On your checkout page, only ask for essential details from your customers. Avoid having a ten-step process that asks them to subscribe to your email list, refer a friend and then take a 10-question survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Pay attention to analytics&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data can be your best friend when it comes to knowing what you need to improve. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/analytics/&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for finding out how your ads are performing, as well as tracking how visitors find your site. &lt;a href=&#34;https://kissmetrics.com/&#34;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt; is another great tool that can help you determine what’s working for your e-commerce site, and what can be improved. If you’re using WordPress, Woocommerce is an easy-to-use e-commerce platform that comes packed with analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Clear call-to-action buttons&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your visitors should never have to search for where they should click next when they want to make a purchase. Make your call-to-action buttons obvious and apparent. You don’t need to have a giant “Click Here” statement in the middle of your page, but you should have a noticeable button that will lead your visitors to sign up for your email list, or even better, make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt; Offer support&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one likes feeling that they’ll be dropped as soon as they finalize their online purchase. On your e-commerce site, make it known that you back up your product or service and that you are willing to help your customers, especially after they click that ‘Submit Order’ button. If you’re running an online tech business, such as reselling domain names or web hosting, make sure your visitors know that if they choose your service, you’ll provide reliable and ongoing tech support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce can be a challenge, but if you apply the right techniques you can see a big boost in online business. If you don’t have your e-commerce site set up quite yet, make sure to take these tips into account to put your online store above the competition!&lt;/p&gt;
