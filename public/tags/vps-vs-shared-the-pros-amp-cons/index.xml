      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared Hosting is the cheapest type of hosting available. Majority of websites and blogs use Shared Hosting owing to its low price. Individuals who intend to get themselves on the Web, usually go with this type of hosting, or in other words, ‘hosting for newbies.’ VPS on the other hand, is a &amp;#8216;more&amp;#8217; fortified type of hosting, and you can get your own IP address with the same. Still can’t make up your mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, both VPS and Shared Hosting have their own benefits. Gauge your requirements and make your decision regarding which type of Hosting is conducive to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
