      <title>Make Your Domain Name More Dynamic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems a simple question, but are you using your domain name to advertise your business? You’ve spent some time coming up with it, but how much are you publicizing it? Read on to find out how to effectively utilize your domain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising by its definition is transient.  Fifteen years ago few people would have even known what you meant when you said the word ‘domain’.  Today every brand and company is expected to utilize the internet. What’s the simplest way of doing this? Use your domain name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity in advertising is one of its attributes that make some ads art. In fact, if all you did was plaster your domain name everywhere you would not end up with desirable results, so there’s advertising’s value in one sentence! Advertising requires creativity, teamwork, brainstorming and much more. With that said, in certain circumstances all you really can do is display your domain name. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many instances advertising space is limited. For example, advertising in a football stadium or other large venue is extremely expensive. Every advertisement in this type of environment needs to send a message to the appropriate audience, but only using a very limited space (more space = higher advertising cost). The most economical way to send a message &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; include a call to action is by showcasing your domain name. This gives your audience a way to act rather than just enjoy your witty advertisement and struggle to remember your brand after!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midphase.comm/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gtlds/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases you may only be able to include your domain name! This is another reason why it is crucial to purchase the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2015/03/how-to-come-up-with-the-perfect-domain/&#34;&gt;ideal domain name for your business&lt;/a&gt;. Do whatever it takes to land the name of your business plus a .com, .biz or other &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com/2015/03/a-glance-of-top-level-domains-and-subdomains/&#34;&gt;TLD (Top Level Domain)&lt;/a&gt;. More and more TLDs are being released every single month in order to give business owners a wider range of options for domain names. If your business is called ‘example’ and example.com is already taken, look for example.net or .info or anything else that may be related to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banner Ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a domain name that fits your company, you can use that name to effectively advertise. Banner ads are effective  when it comes to promoting your domain around the web. These inexpensive ads are a great way to spread your name and get traffic to your website. Clicking on the ad leads the user to your site, but having your domain name on the ad can leave an impression even if they don’t want to leave the site they’re already viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strange Advertising Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have taken up an offer to have a stall at an event. It could be a ballgame or a school fair, so your options for advertising are slim. Make sure what chances you do have imprints your brand domain on people’s mind. Those great cupcakes? “We got them from that stall, what was the name? caketreats.com wasn’t it?”. You see the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Seven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an old rule in advertising called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.krusecontrolinc.com/how-social-media-beats-other-forms-of-marketing-rule-of-7/&#34;&gt;‘Rule of Seven’.&lt;/a&gt; This means that a consumer needs to see your message, or in this case your domain name, at least seven times before they’ll commit it to memory. This is why having your domain name on banner ads is a great way to spread your name. Other simple examples are business cards, fliers, social networking platforms and anywhere else you can fit your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it Easy to Spell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that domains of nine letters or fewer are successful. Think of combining two words: ‘you’ and ‘tube’; ‘face’ and ‘book’. Add words on to the end to make it memorable.  Another tip is to ensure your domain is easy to spell. A big part of advertising is word of mouth. How many times has someone said to you “I’ve seen this great shop online”, then struggles to spell the domain? Tell ten people your domain, and ask them to spell it. If it is catchy and easy to spell, then it will stick in people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we see it, if you’re advertising in any way you have no reason not to include your domain name. It is your easiest – and cheapest – call to action, and these days everyone recognizes a domain name when they see one. &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;Intispace Netmedia&lt;/a&gt; is focused on helping you and your clients come up with the perfect domain names. &lt;strong&gt;Keep checking the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.intispace.com&#34;&gt;intispace blog&lt;/a&gt; for more upcoming tips on starting your own business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is The Status Of Your Domain?</title>
      <link>https://riesal.github.io/2015/05/what-is-the-status-of-your-domain/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to renew your domain name can have costly consequences. Read below about two cases of failed domain name renewals and what you can do to prevent the same from happening to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-1423&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most instances purchasing a domain name is not as literal as you may think. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that you’re &lt;em&gt;leasing&lt;/em&gt; a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally when you buy a domain name you have the option of how long you’d like to keep it. Most domain registrars will give you the option between one and ten years. This gives you the flexibility to decide how long you’ll need the domain name. When the time is up you are given the option to renew your domain name in order to keep your business online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is the all too common case of forgetting to renew a domain name. This can be detrimental to a business, sometimes leading to a dreaded rebranding. In extreme cases, a business may entirely crumble due to the loss of its domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/activists-turned-an-anti-gay-politicians-website-into-an-lgbt-resource&#34;&gt;Recently, an Idaho state representative&lt;/a&gt; experienced the hassle of losing his domain name. Paul Shepherd, the Idaho Republican, forgot to renew his domain &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulshepherdusa.com/&#34;&gt;www.paulshepherdusa.com&lt;/a&gt;. 21-year old college junior Dylan Hailey noticed that the domain name was expiring soon and jumped on buying it as soon as he could. Hailey turned his newly acquired domain into a website to expose Shepherd’s anti-gay policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hailey did make it known that he would give Shepherd his site back, but under the condition that he makes a donation to the LGBT rights group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shepherd isn’t the first to fail to renew a domain name. Last year, Sony Online Entertainment fell victim to the same process, this time letting their sonyonline.net domain expire. This led to putting thousands of gamers out of commission, causing angry protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony apologized, stating, “DNS issues may take up to 48 hours to resolve. We are really really sorry on this one folks. Embarrassing and preventable. We screwed up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you prevent this from happening to you? Here are some easy tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up automatic renewal.&lt;/strong&gt; This will renew your domain, leaving you to focus on more important matters. However, make sure your credit card details are up to date, otherwise your domain registrar will have no way of billing you automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update your contact information.&lt;/strong&gt; Your registrar will most likely contact you when your domain is about to expire (Resell.biz will do this 30 days prior to the expiration date). Having a current email on record means you will always be kept informed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention if your domain does expire.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do by chance let your domain expire, you should be given a grace period of 30 days, during which you can still renew your domain. Once the grace period is over, you’ll have a short redemption phase (typically around 30 days, but this can vary depending on the top level registrar). You can still renew your domain during this time, but it will cost a hefty fee. After the redemption phase, your domain will be back on the market, available to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renew your domain name for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;/strong&gt; Most registrars allow you to register a domain from anywhere between one and ten years. If you are purchasing a domain that will be vital to your business’s success, we suggest registering it for the maximum amount of time. If you do take this route, make sure you don’t forget to register your domain name seven years down the road!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t fall victim to an expired domain name. Check the status of your domain name by contacting your registrar today. So, What is The Status Of Your Domain ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;Contact&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com/contact-us&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intispace.com support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;if you have any questions regarding domain name renewal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Note: &lt;a href=&#34;http://intispace.com&#34;&gt;Intispace.com&lt;/a&gt; clients can check and renew their domain by accessing control panel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
