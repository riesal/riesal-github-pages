&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone who loves to write fantasizes about making a living through words. Here are some tips on how to make blogging for money a reality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;more-4512&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing can seem like a dream job. Journalists and copywriters may not be particularly well-paid, but many are self-employed and working from home, producing content on subjects they find interesting or know a great deal about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging represents the easiest route into professional writing, without needing a journalist’s technical skills or a copywriter’s instinctive talent for making any subject sound interesting. However, the exponential growth in blogging during this decade means that many thousands of enthusiastic amateurs are already writing for love rather than money. Even those  whose blogs generate income usually have other revenue sources to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have any hope of generating revenue in today’s ultra-competitive blogosphere, it’s crucial to obey the following rules from the outset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it regularly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the volume of online content nowadays, sporadic blogs won’t retain audience levels. Uploading content on a daily basis will ensure people always have a reason to revisit your blog, saving the page in their Favorites and anticipating the next entry or update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it knowledgeably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A genuine passion for your chosen subject/s will make the content stand out and appeal to like-minded individuals. It’s almost impossible to fake interest in something, and audiences will soon migrate elsewhere if they identify a lack of knowledge or passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it professionally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amateur bloggers normally set up a WordPress or BlogSpot address, but this will cut little ice among potential sponsors or affiliates. A more professional approach involves registering a suitable website address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do check your spelling and grammar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, grammatical slip-ups and erratic spelling were less harmful to a blog’s prospects. Nowadays there’s far too much competition for such amateurishness. Proofread and spell-check everything before uploading it, and double-check every fact or statistic for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do it publicly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making money from blogging is incredibly difficult, but it’s practically impossible without significant audience numbers. Take every opportunity to promote each new blog through social media posts, and invite comments from readers, reciprocal links with other bloggers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even adhering to these five steps, it’s reasonable to assume that your first year of blogging will be unpaid. As audience numbers increase and your blog establishes a reputation for engaging and original content, opportunities to generate revenue may then arise. Drop any thoughts of selling banner advertising at this stage since a website needs to receive hundreds of thousands of monthly impressions to interest digital advertising agencies and their blue-chip clients. It’s also advisable to stay away from those tacky ‘now trending’ clickbait ads if you want to maintain a professional image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers generate revenue through affiliate marketing. This involves sponsored copy that promotes or reviews products and services, with commission generated by people clicking through from your blog. Although this dilutes the impartiality of your blog, affiliate marketing represents a key way to raise income from self-published online content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-money-from-blogging&#34;&gt;Make Money From Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs can also be used as promotional tools for your own products and services, such as a computer hardware specialist who writes about strange IT issues and bizarre requests for assistance. Some people can turn blogs into books, repackaging existing content in a more dynamic form; a number of food bloggers have secured themselves publishing deals on the back of original recipes and online culinary advice. Finally, established bloggers may be approached by corporate clients, to generate content for third-party sites or to act as freelance consultants. Blogging becomes a means to an end in this scenario, creating brand awareness of your knowledge and expertise that opens doors to related opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips For A Successful Business Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;article id=&#34;post-7518&#34;&gt; &lt;section&gt;**A business blog can generate 126% more leads from potential customers, but how can you make it a success? Here are six top tips…**&lt;span id=&#34;more-7518&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The one thing the internet does is give everyone a voice.Tumblr alone has over 220 million blog accounts currently registered. [Almost a quarter of internet time][1] is spent either reading blogs or on social networks, and it’s been calculated that small businesses with their own blogs get [126%][2] more leads from potential new customers than blogless rivals.&lt;/p&gt; 

Unlike personal blogs, successful business blogs require planning and research as well as a long-term commitment to creating interesting and original content. Here are six guidelines to help ensure your blogs achieve your company’s long-term marketing goals and open up new audiences:

  * **Make it relevant.**

If your business is photography, blogging about your partner’s personal indiscretions or your political views won’t attract many new customers. Concentrate on your primary industry, but feel free to go off on tangents; a photographer could blog about Britain’s increasingly erratic weather, or why certain high street photography chains were rescued while other retailers went to the wall.

Having a clear objective from the outset will help to ensure that each blog achieves the predetermined objectives – some business bloggers want to boost their search engine rankings and increase their social media presence, while others simply want to sound authoritative. Study competitor blogs – what are they trying to achieve? What are they saying that’s different to you?

  * **Make it interesting.**

Online attention spans are very short, and there are myriad blogs competing for readers. Strong opinions and original perspectives are useful for engaging an audience, but so are detailed message-driven headlines, such as the ones [Disney Parks][3] use. A strong opening paragraph is crucial – particularly if it mentions current events. Always put the most important details first for maximum impact – tt gives a blog a ‘hook’ as newspapers call it. Many successful blogs like America’s [Southwest Airlines][4] use a combination of different media to maintain interest, from articles and surveys to photos and videos.

Images are a great way to add value to blogs. If you are imparting a piece of knowledge, then punctuate your posting with a suitable image. It gives the reader time to think about what you’ve said and also breaks up the text.

  * **Make it concise.**

Keep your blogs as short as your sentences. Opinions vary on the perfect length, but 300-400 words should be sufficient to convey a point. Use sub-headers and bullet points to break up the text, and try not to use more than one comma per sentence, but also be aware that the reader may not be following your thoughts so don’t be comma-phobic. From Vine to Flappy Bird, the internet is all about short bursts of intense content – business blogs should maintain this principle.

  * **Make it regular.**

To paraphrase an old sporting cliché, you’re only as good as your last blog. If that was published six months ago, you’re not very good at blogging. People who like your tone of voice or comments will expect regular updates, which will in turn keep your brand in the public eye and ensure you’ll be thought of when readers need your services. A blog a week should be the minimum target, particularly since search engines rank regularly-updated websites more highly than sporadically-updated ones. This is a key reason to host your blog on your corporate website, rather than on an external site like Blogger.

  * **Make it count with search engines.**

Many companies blog to improve their SEO rankings. If you run a small dairy, using the word “cheese” six times in each post can considerably improve your search engine results. Conduct Google Analytics tests to see which phrases people search for in your industry, and use some of these phrases (also known as long tail keywords) in each blog. Regularly review your ranking results through Google Analytics, or using rank-tracking tools like Moz.

  * **Make it interactive.**

There are numerous ways to make blogs interactive, from comments sections through to social media. Platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn encourage people to share content they like, so always post links to your work in case new readers discover you. Posting links to blogs through your company’s Twitter account or Google+ page also means less work creating original content for these platforms.

**Our [scalable WordPress hosting][5] makes sure your business blog is accessible from all devices, with our responsive editor allowing you to preview your site in all formats. [Get started today][5]!**&lt;/section&gt; &lt;/article&gt;
